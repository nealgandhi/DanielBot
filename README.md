# DanielBot
A Bot created for the UTD ECS Discord Server based on our mascot, Daniel the Duck

#### Created By
Neal Gandhi, Aditya Rathod, Alex Habich, Jane "jabe" Luo, Travis Dula, Brandon Philachack, and Huy Nguyen

## Overview
The Daniel bot, referred to as Daniel, is being developed to deliver ease of access to all the necessary functionality
that every discord needs while also incorporating the key features that we as students would like to see for
academic-based discords. We aim to add features that create roles and channels that let us, the moderation team,
organize the server.

### Context
Around April, we came to a decision that the system we had in place to create class related categories was inefficient.
We decided that automating this process would be best, and we came to the conclusion that we should develop a discord
bot. 

### About the Server
UTD ECS (previously UTD CS), also called the “Duck Server,” is a growing casual online community for engineering and
computer science students to discuss work, school, life, and share how they feel about things. In contrast to student
organization Discord servers, which tend to be more professional, the Duck Server is a great place to just blow off some
steam and share some memes.

Interestingly, it is this casual culture that creates engaged users and has them coming back. Empirically, we have
noticed that users that repeatedly engage with the community have done so after participating in three main events:
meme storms, spam chains, and star sprees. Defining these events are beyond the scope of this document but should be
self-evident to any active Duck Server member. As such, any bot that supplements this community must be consistent with
this laid-back and memey culture. One great example of a bot integrating with our community is the third-party bot Carl,
who frequently drops quips in chat for people to laugh about and is configurable by server moderators.
